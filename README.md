# WordSorter

I wanted to trim a list of animals I had found into usable data for the Manticore Generator (https://jordan-heath.github.io/ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html). I made this quick app to take an "unsorted list.txt" and create a "sorted list.txt".

Sorting is based on alphabetical order. I did notice it would create an alphabetical order of Capital letters, followed by a list of lower-case letters. this did not matter for me. App is untested with numbers different characters.
